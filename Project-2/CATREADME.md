# my-cat.c

## Overview

The `my-cat` program is a simple implementation similar to the Unix `cat` utility. It concatenates and displays the content of one or more files to the standard output. If no files are specified, the program exits without doing anything, effectively performing a no-operation (no-op).

## Usage

```plaintext
my-cat [file ...]
```

- `[file ...]`: Optional. One or more files to concatenate and display. If no files are provided, `my-cat` performs a no-op.

## Compilation

To compile the `my-cat` program, use the following gcc command:

```bash
gcc -o my-cat my-cat.c
```

This command compiles the source code into an executable named `my-cat`.

## Functionality

The main functionalities of the `my-cat` program include:

- **No Files Specified**: If invoked without any file arguments, the program exits immediately with a return code of `0`, performing no actions.
- **Reading and Displaying File Contents**: For each file specified in the command line arguments, the program attempts to open the file and read its content. The content is then printed to the standard output (`stdout`).
- **Error Handling**: If a file cannot be opened, an error message `my-cat: cannot open file` is printed to the standard output, and the program exits with a return code of `1`.

## Examples

To display the content of a single file:

```bash
./my-cat file1.txt
```

To concatenate and display the contents of multiple files:

```bash
./my-cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

## Error Messages

- If the program fails to open a file, it prints `my-cat: cannot open file` to the standard output and exits with a return code of `1`.

## Exit Codes

- `0`: Program executed successfully, all specified files were opened, and their contents displayed.
- `1`: Program encountered an error, such as failure to open a specified file.

## Implementation Details

- The program iterates over each argument provided to it, treating each as a filename to be opened and read.
- For each file, it reads and prints the content using a buffer of fixed size (`1024` bytes). This size is a compromise between memory usage and performance but might not be optimal for all situations.
- It uses the standard C library functions `fopen`, `fgets`, and `fclose` for file operations.
- In case a file cannot be opened, it prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code, indicating failure.

## Notes

- The buffer size of `1024` bytes is chosen arbitrarily and may not be optimal for all files or systems. Adjustments might be necessary for handling very large lines or optimizing performance.
- The program does not support reading from standard input (stdin) if no files are provided, differing from the traditional Unix `cat` command in this aspect.
